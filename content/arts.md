# Arts and Design

I view art as a way to make meaning out of the issues I care about, including public health issues.

## Animation

I have a background in animation. I've made short films including an [animated documentary about the food for sale in a Bodega](https://youtu.be/PvTN0ZQWifw?feature=shared). I've also used animation to make a [vlog series about health communication](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLStduNqtQKzHw-rLUMUZIm8LoKGxlmP5r).

As more of a creative outlet, I've also gotten into making work/study background videos:

## Game Design

I love games as ways to make shared language around uncommon experiences. I've designed one board game to do so around public health so far:

- [UNFUNDABLE](https://www.unfundable.fun): A board game about the collaborative yet competitive world of academic public health.

## Teaching

I incorporate the arts into workshops introducing the concepts I study. I find it helpful to relate these big ideas to more everyday experiences. Here are a few examples from my master's thesis:

- [What does health equity feel like?](https://hercommunication.pubpub.org/pub/healthyequityfeels/release/2)
- [#AIcoffeeHouse](https://hercommunication.pubpub.org/pub/aicoffeehouse/release/1)
