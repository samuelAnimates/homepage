# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

I'm interested in AI that doesn't tend to come across as AI anymore. Example: Google Maps does tasks that once seemed too complex for machines. Today, this tech is so common that it doesn't tend to come up in discussions of AI. I see the same thing happening with tools like ChatGPT. And I want to explore the public health risks of this shift.

## Resources

I made this site to share some insights from my dissertation. It provides recommendations for research, policy, and practice around AI for health communication:

- [Health Liteacy & AI](https://health-literacy.ai/)

## Research

My dissertation looks at AI in health communication. One paper looks at supervised machine learning to assess how clear health communication is. Another paper looks at large language models (Llama and ChatGPT) to try to do the same thing. Use the link above to visit the website I made for my dissertation. There will be more in-depth journal articles coming soon!

## Teaching

I have taught one-off sessions about the risks and opportunities of AI for public health. Here are a few:

- "Incorporating AI into material production and assessment: Opportunities, challenges, and pitfalls." Workshop at: 2024 [IHA Health Literacy Conference](https://hlc.iha4health.org/).
- "Person-centered use of artificial intelligence for health literacy: Risks and opportunities." Panel at:  2024 [Health Literacy Annual Research Conference](https://harcconf.org/).
