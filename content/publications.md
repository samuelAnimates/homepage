# Published Work

It's important to me to share the things I learn. Sometimes this takes the form of a research paper. Other times it takes the form of an opinion piece. Other times, I share my experience with journalists. Here's a sampling of this work.

## Op-Eds

I took part in the [Public Voices Fellowship](https://academyhealth.org/blog/2023-11/academyhealth-names-2023-cohort-public-voices-fellowship-academyhealth-partnership-oped-project), with the Op Ed Project and Academy Health. This helped me find my voice for audiences outside of research. Here are the op-eds I've published so far:

- "[Anti-Science Harassment is on the Rise](https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2024/08/14/anti-science-harassment-rise-opinion)". In: _Inside Higher Ed_.
- "[Medical disinformation is bad for our health and for democracy](https://thefulcrum.us/media-technology/health-misinformation)". In: _The Fulcrum_.
- "[Harassment in public health is real. Hereâ€™s how to respond](https://harvardpublichealth.org/policy-practice/peter-hotez-wont-be-the-last-health-worker-harassed-online/)". In: _Harvard Public Health_.

## Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles

Journal articles help researchers build on each others' work. For a full record of mine, check out my [ORCID page](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4402-1885). Here are some highlights.

One topic I study is the role of social media in public health. Sometimes I use statistics and computational methods to study large amounts of communication. Other times, I use qualitative methods to go more in-depth with smaller amounts. These are some of the subjects I've studied:

- [US state public health agencies' use of Twitter](https://doi.org/10.2196/59786)
- [Social media use by community organizations](http://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-13-1129)

Another topic I study is the role of technology in access to health care:

- [Effectiveness of remote cognitive behavioral therapy](https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X231151788)
- [Co-design of a website to increase diversity in clinical trials](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246098)

I'm also interested in the unintended harms of online communication in public health:

- [Lowering the harm of online harassment in public health](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2024.2358141)
- [Unintended risks of data sharing for community-engaged research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.115895)

## Reference Book Chapters

Reference books are other important outlets for researchers. They help students and professionals get more familiar with a particular research area.

- [LGBTQ+ adolescent health and media](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818872-9.00175-8). In: _Encyclopedia of Child and Adolescent Health_.
